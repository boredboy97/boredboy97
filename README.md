- 👋 Hi, I’m @boredboy97, a pharmacist gearing towards software development!
- 👀 I’m interested in Web applications and services and would eventually love to learn more about AI and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, HTML. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! All projects are welcome while I'm still exploring my passions! Would be especially interested in a combination of software development and the medical field.
